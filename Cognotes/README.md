# Cognotes

## About
Cognotes is a rather simple multi-column, tag-based journaling and note-taking application. It's designed to help absob streams of thoughts and act as a small backlog. It's intended to be a personal assistant during the day, to help maintain a state of flow and focus.

## Contributing

Right now, this is a C# application, but implementations in OSX, Android, Linux or other platforms would be appreciated (they do not have to be in C#).

I've tried to build this sort of thing on the web, and it's usually ended up not being as helpful for concentrating.

## Fin

I hope this helps you. Similar things have helped me in the past, but this applicaiton is ultimately an experiment, the 5th of it's kind I've attempted.
